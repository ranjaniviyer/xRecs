# xRecs

xRecs is a project to recommend books based on plot summary simmilarities with a given movie.

Using movie plot summaries from Wikipedia, a Latent Dirchlet Allocation model was used to generate topics within movie plots. The topic distribution from the movie plots was applied to the book plot summaries from Wikipedia to calculate the distribution of those topics within the book-plot list. The goal was to generate the topic distribution within a single movie plot, compare it to the topic distribution in the book plot list, and recommend the 10 books with the most similar topic distribution as the given movie. Thie topic similarities are tested for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate, with the expectation that the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be recommended within the top 10. However, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not recommended, and further analysis of the plot summaries for the book and movie on Wikipedia show that the summaries on Wikipeida focus on completely different parts of the plot, and therefore, the plot summaries do not carry a similar distribution of topics, as generated by the movie plot LDA model. Further work can include sentiment analysis of reviews of movies and books from Amazon to further tune the recommendation engine.
