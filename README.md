# xRecs

xRecs is a project to recommend books based on plot summary similarities with a given movie.

Using movie and book plot summaries from Wikipedia, I implemented a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to generate topics within the movie plots. The topic distribution from the movie plots was used to find similarities among the book plot summaries. The goal was to calculate the topic distribution within a single movie plot, compare against the topic distribution across all book plots, and recommend the 10 books with the most similar topic distribution to the given movie. Initial tests input the movie plot for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, with the expectation that the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would be among the recommended list of top 10 most similar book plots. However, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was not recommended, and further analysis of the plot summaries of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (book) and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (movie) on Wikipedia showed that the summaries on Wikipedia focus on completely different parts of the plot. Therefore, the plot summaries do not carry a similar distribution of topics, as generated by the movie plot LDA model. Further work can include sentiment analysis of reviews of movies and books from Amazon to further tune the recommendation engine and capture similarities that are not expressed on Wikipedia plots.
